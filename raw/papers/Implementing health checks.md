Implementing health checks

Services can be designed with all kinds of reliability and resiliency built in, but in order to be reliable
in practice, they must also deal with predictable failures when they occur. At Amazon, we build
services to be horizontally scalable and redundant, because hardware is designed to fail eventually.
Any hard drive has a maximum expected lifetime, and any piece of software is susceptible to crash at
some point. It may seem like a server’s health is binary: it either works, or it doesn’t work at all and
gets out of the way. Unfortunately this isn’t the case. We find that rather than just shutting down,
failing servers can cause unpredictable and sometimes disproportionate harm to a system. Health
checks detect and respond to these kinds of issues automatically.
This article describes how we use health checks to detect and deal with single-server failures, the
things that happen when health checks are not used, and how systems that overreact to health check
failures can turn small problems into complete outages. We also provide insight from our experience
at Amazon about balancing the tradeoffs between various kinds of health check implementations.
Small failures with outsized impact
When I was a new software developer at Amazon, I worked on the website rendering fleet behind
Amazon.com. While working on a change to add some instrumentation and get visibility into how
well the software was running, I unfortunately wrote a bug. The bug triggered rarely, but when it did,
it caused a given web server to render blank error pages on every request. Only restarting the web
server process fixed the issue. We detected the bug and rolled back the change quickly, added plenty
of tests, and improved processes to catch conditions like this in the future. But while the bug was in
production, a few servers in a large fleet ended up in this broken state.
One thing that made the bug especially tricky to find was that the server didn’t realize it was
unhealthy. Also, the server lost the ability to report its health into monitoring systems, so it was not
taken out of service automatically, and it didn’t trigger its regular alarms. Making matters worse, the
server became very fast and began producing blank error pages much faster than its peer “healthy
servers” were rendering happy webpages. The load-balancing technology we used at the time
favored fast servers over slow ones, so it directed a disproportionate amount of traffic to the
unhealthy servers, which increased the impact even further.
Other alarms triggered, since monitoring involves measuring error rates and latency from multiple
points in the system. While these kinds of monitoring systems and operational processes can serve
as a backstop to contain the problem, the right health checks can significantly minimize the impact
of this whole class of errors by detecting and acting on failures quickly.
Health check tradeoffs
Health checks are a way of asking a service on a particular server whether or not it is capable of
performing work successfully. Load balancers ask each server this question periodically to determine
which servers it is safe to direct traffic to. A service that polls messages from a queue might
ask itself whether it is healthy before it decides to poll more work from the queue. Monitoring
agents—running on each server or on an external monitoring fleet—might ask servers whether
they're healthy so that they can raise an alarm or automatically deal with servers that are failing.
As we saw in my website bug example, when an unhealthy server stays in service, it can
disproportionately decrease the availability of the service as a whole. With a fleet of ten servers, one
bad server means that the availability of the fleet would be 90% or less. Making matters worse, some
load-balancing algorithms, such as “least requests,” give more work to the fastest server. When a
server fails, it often begins failing requests quickly, creating a “black hole” in the service fleet by
Implementing health checks

attracting more requests than healthy servers. In some cases, we add extra protection to prevent
black holes by slowing down failed requests to match the average latency of successful requests.
However, there are other scenarios, such as with queue pollers, where this issue is more difficult to
work around. For example, if a queue poller is polling messages as fast as it can receive them, a failed
server will become a black hole as well. With such a diverse set of environments for distributing work,
the way we think about protecting a partially-failed server varies from system to system.
We find that servers fail independently for any number of reasons, including disks that become
unwritable and cause requests to fail immediately, clocks that skew abruptly and cause calls to
dependencies to fail authentication, servers that fail to retrieve updated crypto material and cause
decryption and encryption to fail, critical support processes that crash because of their own bugs,
memory leaks, and deadlocks that freeze processing.
Servers also fail for correlated reasons that cause many or all servers in a fleet fail together.
Correlated reasons include outage of a shared dependency and large-scale network issues.
The ideal health check will test every aspect of server and application health, perhaps even verifying
that non-critical supporting processes are running. However, trouble arises when the health check
fails for a non-critical reason and when that failure is correlated across servers. If automation removes
servers from service when they still could have performed useful work, the automation does more
harm than good.
The difficulty with health checks is this tension between, on the one hand, the benefits of thorough
health checks and quickly mitigating single-server failures and, on the other hand, the harm done by
a false positive failure across the entire fleet. Thus, one of the challenges of building a good health
check is to guard carefully against false positives. In general, this means that the automation
surrounding health checks should stop directing traffic to a single bad server but keep allowing traffic
if the entire fleet appears to be having trouble.
Ways to measure health
There are many things that can break on a server, and there are many places in our systems where
we measure server health. Some health checks can definitively report that a particular server is
independently broken, while others are fuzzier and report false positives in the case of correlated
failures. Some health checks are difficult to implement. Others are implemented at setup with
services like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Elastic Load Balancing. Each type of
health check has its strengths.
Liveness checks
Liveness checks test the basic connectivity to a service and the presence of a server process. They are
often performed by a load balancer or external monitoring agent, and they are unaware of the details
about how an application works. Liveness checks tend to be included with the service and do not
require an application author to implement anything. Some examples of liveness checks that we use
at Amazon include the following:
• Tests that confirm that a server is listening on its expected port and accepting new TCP
connections.
• Tests that perform a basic HTTP requests and make sure that the server responds with a 200
status code.
• Status Checks for Amazon EC2 that test for basic things that are necessary for any system to
operate, such as network reachability.
Implementing health checks

Local health checks
Local health checks go further than liveness checks to verify that the application is likely to be able
to function. These health checks test resources that are not shared with the server’s peers. Therefore,
they are unlikely to fail on many servers in the fleet simultaneously. These health checks test for the
following:
• Inability to write to or read from disk—It may be tempting to believe that a stateless service
doesn't require a writable disk. However, at Amazon our services tend to use their disks for
things like monitoring, logging, and publishing asynchronous metering data.
• Critical processes crashing or breaking—Some services take requests using an on-server proxy
(similar to NGINX) and perform their business logic in another server process. A liveness check
might only test whether the proxy process is running. A local health check process might pass
through from the proxy to the application to check that both are running and answering
requests correctly. Interestingly, in the website example from the beginning of the article, the
existing health check was deep enough to ensure that the rendering process was running and
responding but not deep enough to ensure it was responding correctly.
• Missing support processes—Hosts that are missing their monitoring daemons might leave
operators "flying blind" and unaware of the health of their services. Other support processes
push metering and billing usage records or receive credential updates. Servers with broken
support processes put functionality at risk in subtle, difficult-to-detect ways.
Dependency health checks
Dependency health checks are a thorough inspection of the ability of an application to interact with
its adjacent systems. These checks ideally catch problems local to the server, such as expired
credentials, that are preventing it from interacting with a dependency. But they can also have false
positives when there are problems with the dependency itself. Because of those false positives, we
must be careful about how we react to dependency health check failures. Dependency health checks
might test for the following:
• Bad configuration or stale metadata—If a process asynchronously looks for updates to
metadata or configuration but the update mechanism is broken on a server, the server can
become significantly out of sync with its peers and misbehave in an unpredictable and
untested way. However, when a server doesn’t see an update for a while, it doesn’t know
whether the update mechanism is broken or the central update system stopped publishing
updates to all servers.
• Inability to communicate with peer servers or dependencies—Strange network behavior has
been known to affect the ability of a subset of servers in a fleet to talk to dependencies
without affecting the ability for traffic to be sent to that server. Software issues, such as
deadlocks or bugs in connection pools, can also hinder network communication.
• Other unusual software bugs that require a process bounce—Deadlocks, memory leaks, or
state corruption bugs can make a server spew errors.
Implementing health checks

Anomaly detection
Anomaly detection looks across all servers in a fleet to determine if any server is behaving oddly
compared to its peers. By aggregating monitoring data per server, we can continuously compare error
rates, latency data, or other attributes to find anomalous servers and automatically remove them
from service. Anomaly detection can find divergence in the fleet that a server cannot detect about
itself, such as the following:
• Clock skew—Especially when servers are under high load, their clocks have been known to
skew abruptly and drastically. Security measures, such as those used to evaluate signed
requests to AWS, require that the time on a client's clock is within five minutes of the actual
time. If it is not, requests fail to AWS services.
• Old code—If a server is disconnected from the network or powered off for a long time and
then comes back on line, it could be running dangerously outdated code that is incompatible
with the rest of the fleet.
• Any unanticipated failure mode—Sometimes servers fail in such a way that they return errors
that they identify error as the client’s instead of theirs (HTTP 400 instead of 500). Servers may
slow down instead of failing, or they may respond faster than their peers, which is a sign that
they’re returning false responses to their callers. Anomaly detection is an incredible catchall
for unanticipated failure modes.
There are few things that must hold true for anomaly detection to work in practice:
• Servers should be doing approximately the same thing—In cases where we explicitly route
different types of traffic to different types of servers, the servers might not behave similarly
enough to detect outliers. However, in cases where we use load balancers to direct traffic to
servers, they are likely responding in similar ways.
• Fleets should be relatively homogeneous—In fleets that include different instance types,
some instances might be slower than others, which can falsely trigger passive bad server
detection. To work around this scenario, we collate metrics by instance type.
• The errors or difference in behavior must be reported—Because we rely on the servers
themselves to report errors, what happens when their monitoring systems are also broken?
Fortunately the client of a service is a great place to add instrumentation. Load balancers like
Application Load Balancer publish access logs that show which backend server was contacted
on every request, the response time, and whether the request succeeded or failed.
Reacting safely to health check failures
When a server determines that it is unhealthy, there are two kinds of actions it can take. In the most
extreme case, it can decide locally that it shouldn't be given any work and take itself out of service
by failing a load balancer health check or by stopping polling a queue. Another way the server could
react is to inform a central authority that it has a problem and let the central system decide how to
handle the issue. The central system can safely address the problem without letting the automation
take down the whole fleet.
There are multiple ways to implement and respond to health checks. This section describes a few
patterns that we use at Amazon.
Implementing health checks

Fail open
Some load balancers can act as a smart central authority. When an individual server fails a health
check, the load balancer stops sending it traffic. But when all servers fail health checks at the same
time, the load balancer fails open, allowing traffic to all servers. We can use load balancers to support
the safe implementation of a dependency health check, perhaps including one that queries its
database and checks to ensure that its non-critical support processes are running.
For example, the AWS Network Load Balancer fails open if no servers are reporting as healthy. It also
fails out of unhealthy Availability Zones if all servers in an Availability Zone reports unhealthy. (For
more information about using Network Load Balancers for health checks, see the Elastic Load
Balancing documentation.) Our Application Load Balancer also supports fail open, as does Amazon
Route 53. (For more information about configuring health checks with Route 53, see the Route 53
documentation.)
When we rely on fail-open behavior, we make sure to test the failure modes of the dependency heath
check. For example, consider a service where the servers connect to a shared data store. If that data
store becomes slow or responds with a low error rate, the servers might occasionally fail their
dependency health checks. This condition causes servers to flap in and out of service but does not
trigger the fail-open threshold. Reasoning out and testing partial failures of dependencies with these
health checks is important to avoid a situation where a failure could cause deep health checks to
make matters worse.
While fail open is a helpful behavior, at Amazon we tend to be skeptical of things that we can’t fully
reason about or test in all situations. We haven’t yet come up with general proofs that fail open will
trigger as we expect for all types of overload, partial failures, or gray failures in a system or in that
system’s dependencies. Because of this limitation, teams at Amazon tend to restrict their fast-acting
load balancer health checks to local health checks and rely on centralized systems to carefully react
to deeper dependency health checks. This isn’t to say we don’t use fail-open behavior or prove that
it works in particular cases. But when logic can act on a large number of servers quickly, we are
extremely cautious about that logic.
Health checks without a circuit breaker
Allowing servers to react to their own problems may seem like the quickest and simplest path to
recovery. However, it is also the riskiest path if the server is wrong about its health or doesn't see the
whole picture of what's happening across the fleet. When all servers across the fleet make the same
wrong decision simultaneously, it can cause cascading failures throughout adjacent services. This risk
presents us with a trade-off. If there is a gap in health checking and monitoring, a server could reduce
the availability of a service until the issue is detected. However, this scenario avoids a complete
service outage due to unexpected health check behavior across a whole fleet.
These are the best practices we follow for implementing health checks when we don't have a circuit
breaker built-in:
• Configure the work producer (load balancer, queue polling thread) to perform liveness and
local health checks. Servers are taken out of service automatically by the load balancer only
if they have some problem that is definitively local to that server, such as a bad disk.
Implementing health checks

• Configure other external monitoring systems to perform dependency health checks and
anomaly detection. These systems could attempt to terminate instances automatically or
alarm or engage an operator.
When we build systems to react automatically to dependency health check failures, we must build in
the right amount of thresholding to prevent the automated system from taking drastic action
unexpectedly. Teams at Amazon that operate stateful servers like Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3,
and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) have important durability requirements
around server replacement. They have also built cautious rate limiting and control feedback loops so
that the automation stops and engages humans when thresholds are crossed. When we build such
automation, we must be sure that we notice when a server fails a dependency health check. For some
metrics, we rely on the servers to self-report their individual status to a central monitoring system.
To compensate for cases when the server is so broken that it is unable to report its health, we also
actively reach out to them to check their health.
Prioritize your health
Especially in overload conditions, it is important for servers to prioritize their health checks over their
regular work. In this situation, failing or responding slowly to health checks can make a bad brownout
situation even worse.
When a server fails a load balancer health check, it is asking that load balancer to take it out of service
immediately and for a non-trivial amount of time. When a single server fails, that's not a problem,
but in a traffic surge to the service, the last thing we want is to shrink the size of the service. Taking
servers out of service during an overload can cause a downward spiral. Forcing the remaining servers
take even more traffic makes them more likely to become overloaded, also fail a health check, and
shrink the fleet even more.
The problem is not that overloaded servers return errors when they're overloaded. It's that servers
don't respond to the load balancer ping request in time. After all, load balancer health checks are
configured with timeouts, just like any other remote service call. Browned out servers are slow to
respond for a number of reasons, including high CPU contention, long garbage collector cycles, or
simply running out of worker threads. Services need to be configured to set resources aside to
respond to health checks in a timely way instead of taking on too many additional requests.
Fortunately, there are some straightforward configuration best practices that we follow to help
prevent this kind of downward spiral. Tools like iptables, and even some load balancers, support the
notion of “max connections.” In this case, the OS (or load balancer) limits the number of connections
to the server so that the server process is not flooded with concurrent requests that would have
slowed it down.
When a service is fronted by a proxy or a load balancer that supports max connections, it seems
logical to make the number of worker threads on the HTTP server match the max connections in the
proxy. However, this configuration would set up the service for a downward spiral during a brownout.
Proxy health checks need connections too, and so it is important to make a server's worker pool large
enough to accommodate extra health check requests. Idle workers are cheap, so we tend to configure
extra ones: anywhere from a handful of extra workers to double the configured proxy max
connections.
Another strategy we use to prioritize health checks is for servers to implement their own maximum
concurrent requests enforcement. In this case, load balancer health checks are always allowed, but
Implementing health checks

normal requests are rejected if the server is already working on some threshold. Implementations
around Amazon range from a simple semaphore in Java to the more complex analysis of trends in
CPU utilization.
Another way to help ensure that services respond in time to a health check ping request is to perform
the dependency health check logic in a background thread and update an isHealthy flag that the
ping logic checks. In this case, servers respond promptly to health checks, and the dependency health
checking produces a predictable load on the external system it interacts with. When teams do this,
they are extra cautious about detecting a failure of the health check thread. If that background thread
exits, the server does not detect a future server failure (or recovery!).
Balancing dependency health checks with the scope of impact
Dependency health checks are appealing because they act as a thorough test of a server’s health.
Unfortunately they can be dangerous because a dependency can cause a cascading failure
throughout a system.
We can draw some insight about handling health check dependencies by looking at our service-
oriented architecture at Amazon. Each service at Amazon is designed to do a small number of things;
there is no monolith that does everything. There are many reasons we like to build services this way,
including faster innovation with small teams and reduced scope of impact if there is a problem with
one service. This architectural design can apply to health checks too.
When one service calls another service, it’s taking a dependency on that service. If a service only calls
the dependency sometimes, we might consider the dependency to be a “soft dependency,” since the
service can still do some types of work even if it can’t talk to the dependency. Without fail-open
protection, implementing a health check that tests a dependency turns that dependency into a “hard
dependency.” If the dependency is down, the service also goes down, creating a cascading failure
with increased scope of impact.
Even though we separate functionality into different services, each service likely serves multiple APIs.
Sometimes, APIs on the service have their own dependencies. If one API is impacted, we prefer for
the service to continue serving the other APIs. For example, a service can be both a control plane
(such as occasionally-called CRUD APIs on long-living resources) and a data plane (high throughput
business-super-critical APIs). We would want the data plane APIs to continue to operate even if the
control plane APIs are having trouble talking to their dependencies.
Similarly, even a single API may behave differently depending on the input or state of the data. A
common pattern is a Read API that queries a database but caches responses locally for some time. If
the database is down, the service can still serve cached reads until the database is back online. Failing
health checks if only one code path is unhealthy increases the scope of impact of a problem talking
to a dependency.
This discussion of which dependency to health check raises an interesting question about the trade-
offs between microservices and relatively monolithic services. There is rarely a clear-cut rule for how
many deployable units or endpoints to break a service into, but the questions of “which dependencies
to health check” and “does a failure then increase the scope of impact” are interesting lenses to use
to determine how micro or macro to make a service.
Implementing health checks

Real things that have gone wrong with health checks
All of this may make sense in theory, but what happens to systems in practice when they don’t get
health checks right? We looked for patterns in stories from AWS customers and from around Amazon
to help illustrate the bigger picture. We also looked into compensating factors – the sorts of “belt
and suspenders” that teams implement to prevent a weakness in a health check from causing a
widespread issue.
Deployments
One pattern of health check problems involves deployments. Deployment systems like AWS
CodeDeploy push new code to one subset of the fleet at a time, waiting for one deployment wave to
complete before moving on to the next. This process relies on servers reporting back to the
deployment system once they’re up and running with the new code. If they don’t report back, the
deployment system sees that there is something wrong with the new code and rolls back the
deployment.
The most basic service startup deployment script would simply fork the server process and
immediately respond “deployment done” to the deployment system. However this is dangerous
because so many things can go wrong with the new code: the new code could crash right after
launching, get hung up and fail to start listening on a server socket, fail to load configuration needed
to process requests successfully, or encounter a bug. When a deployment system isn’t configured to
test against a dependency health check, it doesn’t realize that it is pushing a bad deployment. It
marches along breaking one server after another.
Fortunately, in practice Amazon teams implement multiple mitigating systems to prevent this
scenario from taking out their whole fleet. One such mitigation is to configure alarms that trigger
whenever the overall fleet size is too small or running at high load, or when there is high latency or
error rate. If any of these alarms trigger, the deployment system halts the deployment and rolls back.
Another type of mitigation is to use phased deployments. Instead of deploying the whole fleet in a
single deployment, the service can be configured to deploy a subset, perhaps an Availability Zone,
before pausing and running a full suite of integration tests against that zone. This deployment-per-
Availability Zone alignment is convenient because services are already designed to be able to keep
operating if there are problems with a single Availability Zone.
And of course before deploying to production, Amazon teams push those changes through test
environments and run automated integration tests that would catch this type of failure. However,
subtle and unavoidable differences between production and test environments may exist, so it is
important to combine many layers of deployment safety to catch all kinds of problems before
causing impact in production. While health checks are important to protect services against bad
deployments, we make sure to not stop there. We think about the “belt and suspenders” approaches
that serve as backstops to protect fleets from these and other mistakes.
Asynchronous processors
Another pattern of failure is around asynchronous message processing, such as a service that gets its
work by polling an SQS Queue or Amazon Kinesis Stream. Unlike in systems that take requests from
load balancers, there isn’t anything automatically performing health checks to remove servers from
service.
When services don’t have deep enough health checks, individual queue worker servers can have
failures like disks filling up or running out of file descriptors. This issue won’t stop the server from
Implementing health checks

pulling work off the queue, but it will stop the server from being able to successfully process
messages. This issue has resulted in delayed message processing, where the bad server pulls off work
from the queue quickly and fails to deal with it.
In these kinds of situations, there are often several compensating factors to help contain the impact.
For example, if a server fails to process the message that it pulls off SQS, then SQS redelivers that
message to another server after a configured message visibility timeout. End-to-end latency
increases, but messages are not dropped. Another compensating factor is an alarm that goes off
when there are too many errors processing messages, alerting an operator to investigate.
Disks filling up
Another class of failures we see is when disks on servers fill up, causing both processing and logging
to fail. This failure leads to a gap in monitoring visibility, since the server might not be able to report
its failures to the monitoring system.
Again, several mitigating controls keep services from “flying blind” and mitigate impact quickly.
Systems fronted by a proxy such as an Application Load Balancer or API Gateway will have error rate
and latency metrics produced by that proxy. In this case, alarms fire even if the server isn’t reporting
them. For queue-based systems, services like Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) report
metrics that indicate that processing is delayed for some messages.
The thing that these solutions have in common is that there are multiple layers of monitoring. The
server itself reports errors, but so does an external system. The same principle is important with
health checks. An external system can test the health of a given system more accurately than it can
test itself. This is why with AWS Auto Scaling, teams configure a load balancer to do external ping
health checks.
Teams also write their own custom health check system to periodically ask each server if it is healthy
and report to AWS Auto Scaling when a server is unhealthy. One common implementation of this
system involves a Lambda function that runs every minute, testing the health of every server. These
health checks can even save their state between each run in something like DynamoDB so that they
don’t inadvertently mark too many servers as unhealthy at once.
Zombies
Another pattern of problems includes zombie servers. Servers can become disconnected from the
network for periods of time but remain running, or they can power off for extended periods and later
be rebooted.
When zombie servers come back to life they can be significantly out of sync with the rest of the fleet,
which can cause serious problems. For example, if a zombie server is running a much older,
incompatible software version, it can cause failures when it tries to interact with a database with
different schema or it can use the wrong configuration.
To deal with zombies, systems often reply to health checks with their currently running software
version. Then a central monitoring agent then compares the responses across the fleet to look for
anything running an unexpectedly out of date version and prevents these servers from moving back
into service.
Implementing health checks

In conclusion
Servers, and the software that runs on them, fail for all kinds of weird reasons. Hardware eventually
physically breaks. As software developers, we eventually write some bug like the one I describe above
that puts the software into a broken state. Multiple layers of checks, from lightweight liveness checks
to passive monitoring of per-server metrics, are needed to catch all types of unexpected failure
modes.
When these failures happen, it is important to detect them and take the affected servers out of
service quickly. However, as with any fleet automation, we add rate-limiting, thresholding, and circuit
breakers that turn off automation and involve humans in situations of uncertainty or in extreme
situations. Failing open and building centralized actors are strategies for reaping the benefits of deep
health checking with the safety of rate-limited automation.
